INFORMATION

I've included an update for the 3d ego shooter game Shot It to version 1.3.
This update is necessary if you're having a lower version than 1.3 and if you want to
create and play own levels for this game. Anyway, version 1.4 with sounds is out, so it's
recommended that you download this version, if you're interested.
If you don't want to do this or if you're having Shot It version 1.3 or later, you just
need to extract the DX Cad Version 1.02.zip.
